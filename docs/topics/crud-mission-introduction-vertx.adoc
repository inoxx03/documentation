= Introduction

This Booster showcases simple database interaction in a Cloud environment. The example application exposes an HTTP API, which provides _CRUD_ endpoints to manipulate data through _create_, _read_, _update_, and _delete_ operations. The API consumes and provides JSON documents which contain information about the request to be processed and the response returned from the system. This project exposes a CRUD HTTP endpoint and a UI to use this service. The CRUD endpoint is implemented using a reactive {VertX} application and the {VertX} asynchronous JDBC client. The UI allows you interact with service using a web interface, or by making HTTP requests directly on the service endpoints.

The project also includes integration tests to verify the functionality of the service.

The application lets you make POST, PUT, GET and DELETE requests to:

* retrieve a list of fruits
* create new fruits
* edit existing fruits
* delete fruits

The CRUD endpoint follows the HTTP recommendations in terms of HTTP verb and status.

To build and deploy this Booster you can:

* deploy it to OpenShift using Apache Maven.
* deploy it to OpenShift using a pipeline.

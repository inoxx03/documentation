= Launch Your Booster

To launch your booster from the launch screen, you have the following options.

[[launchpad-launch-booster-cd]]
== Launch Using Continuous Delivery

To launch using continuous delivery, click the _Launch on OpenShift_ button.

This will:

* Create a new GitHub repository associated with your account containing the mission's code.
* Create a pipeline to continuously deliver your mission's code.
* The pipeline will then build and deploy your mission's code to {OpenShiftLocal}.  The first launch and deployment should take under 10 minutes on most systems (depending upon resources and internet connection) as the docker images powering the build are downloaded and cached; subsequent runs will be faster.

Click on the _See it here!_ link under _Creating your project on the OpenShift cloud_ to go to your booster's page in {OpenShiftLocal}.

To view the status of your project:

* In the pipeline at the top, click _View Log_.
+
NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the link to appear.

* This will prompt you with a log in for Jenkins. Click _Login with OpenShift_
* Use your {OpenShiftLocal} credentials, for example `developer` for both the username and password.
* Ensure all the boxes are checked and click _Allow selected permissions_.

You will be redirected to the startup logs in the `jenkins` pod. You have also given {OpenShiftLocal} access to the `jenkins` pod and its logging information. Once you see the build start in the Jenkins logs, if you return to the _Overview_ page for your project in {OpenShiftLocal}, you cans see that the pipelines now show the build status.

Once your booster is deployed, you can then interact with its application or applications. You can find more details on how to interact with a mission's booster in the _interaction section_ of each mission's guide. For example, if you deployed the {VertX} REST HTTP mission booster, use the link:{link-mission-http-api-vertx}#interact[Interact with the Unmodified {VertX} Booster] section in {mission-http-api-vertx-guide-name}. You can find a full list of mission guides in xref:available-missions[Available Missions].

NOTE: Each mission guide covers deploying as well as interacting with the booster. If you have already deployed your booster using the steps above, you can skip the _deployment section_ in the mission guide and proceed to the _interaction section_.

[[launchpad-launch-booster-manual]]
== Launch Manually

To launch manually, click on _Download Zip_ and follow the instructions in the mission's guide. For example, if you deployed the {VertX} API Level 0 mission, use the link:{link-mission-http-api-vertx}#build_and_deploy_booster[Build and Deploy Your Booster] section in {mission-http-api-vertx-guide-name}. You can find more details on how to interact with a mission in the interaction section of each mission's guide. You can find a full list of mission guides in xref:available-missions[].

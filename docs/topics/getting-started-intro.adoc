When starting to create cloud-native applications and services, you need a local development environment that matches the target cloud environment.
The {OpenShiftLocal} provides an out-of-the-box solution for setting up such environment on your local machine without the need for extensive setup and configuration, while the {launcher} application gives you a hassle-free way of creating functional example applications called Missions and easily building and deploying them to a cloud environment.
The Missions are designed to showcase various fundamental pieces of building cloud-native applications and services, such as creating HTTP APIs, integrating your application with a relational database to provide persistent data storage, implementing the health check and circuit-breaker patterns to ensure that your services can withstand traffic overload and network issues, externalizing the configuration of your applications to make them more secure and easier to scale, and securing your applications with Red Hat Single Sign-on to provide authentication and authorization functionalities.
Each mission comprises different Boosters that show how to implement the same mission in different runtimes and can be updated or extended for your own use case.
The {launcher} application handles the Continuous Integration setup and repository creation tasks for you and lets you focus on your code.
